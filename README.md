Depression can often affect the entire body if left untreated or under-treated. It can increase the risk of adverse cardiac events, including heart attack or blot clots. Also, it can increase the risk of cardiovascular conditions like high blood pressure, and weaken the immune system, which leads to increasing stress on the body. All of these can lead to increased healthcare costs.

My goal was to analyze reviews found on webmd.com to find which SSRI had the highest reviewed effectiveness and compare their reviewed satisfaction and effectiveness based on the patient age, gender and condition being treated. I used the WebMD Drug Reviews Dataset on Kaggle that contains over 300,000 reviews collected between 2007 and March 2020, focusing on the five main SSRIs: Zoloft, Lexapro, Celexa, Prozac and Paxil. I thought this would lead to interesting insights since the effectiveness of these medications is subjective overall.
